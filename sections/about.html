                                                JSS provides invaluable opportunities 
                                                for exposure to Japanese culture and unites students 
                                                with a shared passion for Japanâ€™s vibrant traditions, 
                                                arts and language. Our regular events revolve around 
                                                various aspects of Japanese traditional and popular 
                                                culture, and selected topics in Japanese Studies. Recent

                                                Every year in June/July, we organise a Freshmen

                                                We also strengthen bilateral ties through extensive

                                                also conduct university visits for incoming students from Japan 
                                                where Japanese students and JSS members can interact and build
