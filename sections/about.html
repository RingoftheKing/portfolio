                                                I am a Year 4 undergraduate student studying Computer Science at NUS. <br>
                                                My focus area is in software engineering and artificial intelligence. 
                                                I have created practical RAG systems for companies and startups alike during my internships, 
                                                allowing them to create specialised chatbots tailored to their company needs.
                                                I have also created computer vision systems for primary school sports competitions that assist judges to make effective calls.

                                                Beyond AI work, my hobbies include game development, focusing mostly on the code but I'm open to learning the artistic work that goes into assets of a polished game.

                                                JSS provides invaluable opportunities 
                                                for exposure to Japanese culture and unites students 
                                                with a shared passion for Japanâ€™s vibrant traditions, 
                                                arts and language. Our regular events revolve around 
                                                various aspects of Japanese traditional and popular 
                                                culture, and selected topics in Japanese Studies. Recent

                                                Every year in June/July, we organise a Freshmen 
                                                Orientation Camp, open to all incoming first-year students 
                                                interested in Japan, to welcome them into the university.

                                                We also strengthen bilateral ties through extensive

                                                and the local Japanese community. Currently, we maintain our

                                                sessions with partner universities and our Brothers-and-Sisters

                                                pandemic-free times, we organise a mutual homestay exchange 
                                                programme with our counterparts from Kyushu University where

                                                Kyushu University students during their stay in Singapore. We 
                                                also conduct university visits for incoming students from Japan 
                                                where Japanese students and JSS members can interact and build 
                                                new friendships through a mutual cultural exchange.
